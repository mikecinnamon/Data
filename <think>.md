First, I need to understand the total cost of the dinner. However, since the exact amount isn't provided, I'll assume the total cost is \( X \) dollars.

Next, I'll determine how the cost is shared in both scenarios. Initially, only six friends are paying, so each of them would pay \( \frac{X}{6} \) dollars. If all ten friends were to pay, each would contribute \( \frac{X}{10} \) dollars.

To find out how much cheaper it would be for each of the six friends, I'll subtract the amount each would pay when everyone contributes from the amount they originally paid. That is, \( \frac{X}{6} - \frac{X}{10} \).

Simplifying this expression, I get \( \frac{10X - 6X}{60} = \frac{4X}{60} = \frac{X}{15} \) dollars. Therefore, each of the six friends would save \( \frac{X}{15} \) dollars if all ten friends shared the cost equally.

Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

**Problem Statement:**
Ten friends have dinner at a restaurant. Four of them don't carry any money, so the remaining six friends pay for everyone. We need to determine how much cheaper it would be for each of these six friends if everyone had paid equally.

**Solution:**

1. **Total Cost:**
   Let's assume the total cost of the dinner is \( X \) dollars.

2. **Initial Payment by Six Friends:**
   - Since only six friends are paying, each of them pays:
     \[
     \frac{X}{6} \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Payment if All Ten Friends Pay:**
   - If all ten friends share the cost equally, each person pays:
     \[
     \frac{X}{10} \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Difference in Payment per Friend:**
   - The difference in the amount each of the six friends pays is:
     \[
     \frac{X}{6} - \frac{X}{10}
     \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
     \[
     \frac{X}{6} - \frac{X}{10} = \frac{10X - 6X}{60} = \frac{4X}{60} = \frac{X}{15}
     \]

**Conclusion:**
Each of the six friends would save \(\frac{X}{15}\) dollars if all ten friends paid equally.

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{X}{15}}
\]
